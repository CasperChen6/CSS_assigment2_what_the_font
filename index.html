      Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br>
      But it's the only thing that I know<br>
      When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br>
      It is the only thing makes us feel alive
    </p>
    <p>
      We keep this love in a photograph<br>
      We made these memories for ourselves<br>
      Where our eyes are never closing<br>
      Hearts are never broken<br>
      And time's forever frozen still
    </p>
    <p>
      So you can keep me<br>
      Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
      Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
      You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
    </p>
    <p>
      Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>
      And it's the only thing that I know, know<br>
      I swear it will get easier<br>
      Remember that with every piece of ya<br>
      Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
    </p>
    <p>
      Hmm, we keep this love in this photograph<br>
      We made these memories for ourselves<br>
      Where our eyes are never closing<br>
      Hearts were never broken<br>
      And time's forever frozen, still
    </p>
    <p>
      So you can keep me<br>
      Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
      Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
      You won't ever be alone
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you hurt me<br>
      That's okay, baby, only words bleed<br>
      Inside these pages, you just hold me<br>
      And I won't ever let you go
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait for me to come home<br>
      Wait for me to come home<br>
      Wait for me to come home<br>
      Wait for me to come home
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, you can fit me<br>
      Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br>
      Next to your heartbeat where I should be<br>
      Keep it deep within your soul
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you hurt me<br>
      Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed<br>
      Inside these pages, you just hold me<br>
      And I won't ever let you go
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me<br>
      Under the lamppost back on Sixth street<br>
      Hearing you whisper through the phone<br>
      Wait for me to come home
